There's a couple things I like about this mix. The first track, the original for Duke Reid, is such a nice pure example of rocksteady. The left / right split mix of the following Studio 1 versions from Alton and his sister Hortense highlight the different ways they rode the same tune. The horn rinse on the Gibbs version of this track is also a nice trek into what the foundation riddims became in the hands of other producers.
