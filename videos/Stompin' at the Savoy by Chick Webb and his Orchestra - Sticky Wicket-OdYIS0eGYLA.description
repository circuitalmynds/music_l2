Here is a vintage drum cover of the great tune 'Stompin' at the Savoy' by Chick Webb and His Orchestra' that we recorded ages ago and never ended up putting on YouTube. This was filmed before we began using the in-ear monitoring system for Sticky Wicket, hence the audio perhaps not being as good as some of our later videos. We decided to release this however, simply to cheer everyone up a bit while we're all stuck at home for a while. We can only find footage from 1 camera angle too due to my file management back then being not quite as effective as it is now. Hope you enjoy, more great drum videos coming very soon so remember to subscribe.
