"WAKE ME UP"
I‚Äôm walking through a dream
I‚Äôm walking through the finest place I‚Äôve ever seen.
Hey man won‚Äôt you wake me up? 
Hey man won‚Äôt you wake me up?

I‚Äôm walking through the fire
defiant on the wire, burning up my desire
Hey man won't you come, come give me a gun?
help me blow the lights right out of the sun

so won't you tell me if I'm dreaming?
I need to know just where I stand.
it turns out my hands are useless
but maybe I'm a better man.

Wake Me Up!
I said Wake Me Up!

I'm dancing on the screens
I'm dancing in the mountains where I've always been.
Hey man won‚Äôt you wake me up?
Hey man won‚Äôt you wake me up?
I'm kicking down the doors
I'm climbing up the walls of the house that's yours
Hey man won't you come, come give me a gun?
help me blow the lights right out of the sun

so won't you tell me if I‚Äôm dreaming?
I need to know just where I stand.
it turns out my hands are useless
but maybe I'm a better man?

Wake Me Up!
Wake Me Up!
I said Wake Me Up!

I‚Äôm dancing on the serpents,
I'm dancing on the coals,
you deny your own expression,
you deny the things you know.
I'm living through the ages,
I'm dancing on the tiles,
won't commit to any handshake,
or believe a Duchenne smile.

I'm burning all my bridges,
I'm pulling up the ropes,
deleting all the codes, 
no! I'm not that man you know.
you walk into a trap 
then you walk into your youth, 
yr living all that life
in a pair of dusty boots.

so won't you tell me if I'm dreaming?
I need to know just where i stand.
it turns out my hands are useless
but maybe I'm a better man?

Wake me up.
