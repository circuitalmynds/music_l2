For more information and to request a license go to: https://www.brilliantclassicslicensing.com/albums/brunetti-divertimenti/ \n\nProyecto Brunetti is a flexible ensemble formed with the aim of promoting the chamber music of Gaetano Brunetti (1744-1798). Its founder-cellist is Pere Joan Carrascosa, who has also edited the manuscripts of this divertimento collection for publication and written the authoritative booklet essay on the composer\u2019s life and work.\nThe album can be considered a first port of call for anyone looking to investigate the figure of Brunetti. When they do so, they will find music of elegant gestures and appealing gentility, clear-cut melodies and subtle innovation. The greater part of his surviving music is cast in the genre of string trio which was a reliable source of entertainment for both amateur musicians and audiences in the latter half of the 18th century.\n\nThere are 47 such trios in eight collections of six (minus one in the last case), and this album presents the third such collection. Brunetti probably wrote it between 1772 and 1774 while in service to the Prince of Asturias, later to become Charles/Carlo IV of Spain. The Prince himself probably played second fiddle to the composer in those pieces scored with two violins, with the composer\u2019s son Francesco on the cello.\nStructurally straightforward, each divertimento comprises two movements cast in either a basic sonata or rondo form. It is their melodic freshness, harmonic invention and the stylishness of their writing, treating all three parts as equals, that elevates them beyond the value of ephemeral entertainment.\n\nTracklist:\nDivertimento No. 1, L.127:\n0:00 Andante\n3:46 Allegretto\n\nDivertimento No. 2, L.128:\n10:11 Larghetto pastorale\n13:07 Allegretto con moto\n\nDivertimento No. 3, L.129:\n16:49 Largo\n20:17 Rondeau.

The record labels have it edited. \n\nThe legendary band that has been an institution in Mali since the late 1960s, Super Rail Band, mixed traditional African instruments with electric guitars, led by the mesmerizing presence of singer and guitarist Djelimady Tounkara. The Super Rail Band was born out of a Malian government subsidy in the 1950s for local groups to integrate indigenous folk traditions into their music, including Mandingo jeli songs and hunting songs, which the band mixed in with Afro-Cuban dance rhythms, electric guitars and trap drums. For years, the band anchored a lively international scene at the dance bar operated by the Mali Rail Company at the railway station in Bamako, Mali's capital. \nThe Super Rail Band served as an important launching pad for the careers of numerous West African musicians, including kora player and singer Mory Kante, guitarist Kante Manfila and Mory Kante and Salif Keita. \n\nAlto Saxophone \u2013 Tidiani Kon\u00e9 (tracks: 1970 - 1972, 1972 - 1976)\nBass \u2013 Cheik Traor\u00e9 (tracks: 1977 - 1983), Issa Tounkara (tracks: 1977 - 1983)\nBongos \u2013 Korobala (tracks: 1972 - 1976)\nDrums \u2013 Pacheco (5) (tracks: 1972 - 1976)\nGuitar \u2013 Cheik Traor\u00e9 (tracks: 1972 - 1976), Djelimoussa Kouyat\u00e9* (tracks: 1977 - 1983), Mamoutou Diakit\u00e9 (tracks: 1970 - 1972, 1972 - 1976), Ousmane Sogodogo (tracks: 1970 - 1972, 1972 - 1976)\nGuitar [Solo Guitar] \u2013 Nab\u00e9 Baba (tracks: 1970 - 1972)\nGuitar [Solo] \u2013 Djelimady Tounkara (tracks: 1972 - 1976, 1977 - 1983)\nKeyboards \u2013 Alfred Coulibaly (tracks: 1977 - 1983)\nPercussion \u2013 Abdouramane Kouman\u00e9 (tracks: 1970 - 1972, 1972 - 1976, 1977 - 1983), Charri\u00e9 (tracks: 1977 - 1983), Moussa Traor\u00e9 (tracks: 1972 - 1976)\nSaxophone \u2013 Kabin\u00e9 Keita (tracks: 1977 - 1983), L\u00e9di Youla (tracks: 1977 - 1983)\nTenor Saxophone \u2013 Tidiani Kon\u00e9 (tracks: 1970 - 1972, 1972 - 1976)\nTimbales \u2013 Marius (15) (tracks: 1970 - 1972)\nTrumpet \u2013 Moussa Kon\u00e9 (tracks: 1977 - 1983), Sourakata Ciss\u00e9 (tracks: 1972 - 1976), Tidiani Kon\u00e9 (tracks: 1970 - 1972)\nVocals \u2013 Damory Kouyat\u00e9 (tracks: 1977 - 1983), Djelimady Sissoko (tracks: 1972 - 1976, 1977 - 1983), Lanfia Diabat\u00e9 (tracks: 1977 - 1983), Magan Ganessy (tracks: 1972 - 1976, 1977 - 1983), Mory Kant\u00e9 (tracks: 1972 - 1976), Salif Keita (tracks: 1970 - 1972), S\u00e9kou Kant\u00e9 (tracks: 1977 - 1983), S\u00e9kou Kouyat\u00e9 (tracks: 1977 - 1983)\nXylophone [Balafon] \u2013 Mory Kant\u00e9 (tracks: 1972 - 1976)",

This was filmed before we began using the in-ear monitoring system for Sticky Wicket, hence the audio perhaps not being as good as some of our later videos. We decided to release this however, simply to cheer everyone up a bit while we're all stuck at home for a while. We can only find footage from 1 camera angle too due to my file management back then being not quite as effective as it is now. Hope you enjoy, more great drum videos coming very soon so remember to subscribe.\n\nHarry, Next Level Chops",

        "description": "\"Good-Bye Bad Times\" es una canci\u00f3n del cantante y compositor brit\u00e1nico Philip Oakey y del productor Giorgio Moroder. Fue escrito por Oakey y Moroder y grabado para el \u00e1lbum Philip Oakey & Giorgio Moroder. Lanzado como sencillo en el Reino Unido en junio de 1985 como continuaci\u00f3n del \u00e9xito de 1984 de Oakey y Moroder \"Together In Electric Dreams\"; alcanz\u00f3 el n\u00famero 44 en las listas de singles y permaneci\u00f3 en las listas durante 5 semanas.\nEl video musical de \"Good-Bye Bad Times\" fue una producci\u00f3n de alto presupuesto ya que Virgin Records ten\u00eda grandes expectativas para la canci\u00f3n despu\u00e9s del gran \u00e9xito internacional de \"Together in Electric Dreams\". Fue filmada en blanco y negro, dirigida por Steve Barron y tiene una tem\u00e1tica victoriana. Est\u00e1 ambientado en el Londres del siglo XIX y presenta el amor no correspondido entre un caballero de la ciudad y una hermosa chica de clase trabajadora. Oakey aparece insertado en las primeras escenas y luego como cantante en el fondo de un Music Hall vestido con atuendo victoriano. Una paradoja del video es que la m\u00fasica moderna est\u00e1 completamente en desacuerdo con el escenario y el gui\u00f3n gr\u00e1fico.",

        "description": "There's a couple things I like about this mix. The first track, the original for Duke Reid, is such a nice pure example of rocksteady. The left / right split mix of the following Studio 1 versions from Alton and his sister Hortense highlight the different ways they rode the same tune. The horn rinse on the Gibbs version of this track is also a nice trek into what the foundation riddims became in the hands of other producers. \n\nWhy Birds Follow Spring: Alton Ellis\nWhy Birds Follow Spring: Alton Ellis [left channel]\nWhy Birds Fly: Hortense Ellis [right channel]\nWise Bird: Cornell Campbell\nNo Bones For The Dogs: Joe Gibbs & The Professionals [left channel]\nTribesman Rockers: Joe Gibbs & The Professionals [right channel]\nWhy Birds Follow Spring: Cornell Campbell",
